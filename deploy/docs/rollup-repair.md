# Repairing the daily rollup

Removing a bad span from `tracium.spans` is **not** enough to correct the
dashboard. Remediation must clean **both** tables.

## Why deleting the span is not enough

`tracium.metrics_daily` is filled by `metrics_daily_mv`, an **insert trigger**.
Materialized views do not retract on `DELETE`, so whatever a bad span
contributed to the rollup stays there after the span itself is gone.

This is easy to miss, because the two halves of the product disagree:

| Dashboard window | Reads from | After deleting the span |
|---|---|---|
| 24h / 7d / 30d | raw `tracium.spans` | recovers immediately |
| 90d / 1y | `tracium.metrics_daily` | **stays wrong forever** |

An operator deletes the offending span, watches the short windows return to
normal, and concludes the incident is over. The long windows keep serving the
poisoned figure with no visible cause.

```sql
ALTER TABLE tracium.spans DELETE WHERE name = 'huge.tokens';  -- 0 rows remain
SELECT cost FROM tracium.metrics_daily WHERE user_id = 'affected-user';
-- 3458764513820.541   ← still there
```

## The repair

The `repair-rollup` command rebuilds specific `bucket_date` days from the raw
spans, using the same aggregation each materialized view performs. It ships in
the API image (`ghcr.io/tracium/api`) and rebuilds **both** rollups —
`tracium.metrics_daily` and `tracium.metrics_daily_cost` — in one run.

It connects over ClickHouse's native protocol via `CLICKHOUSE_DSN` (the same
value the API uses), so run it in-cluster where port 9000 is reachable — e.g. a
one-off pod from the API image, or `docker compose run`:

```bash
# 1. Remove the bad spans from the raw table.
clickhouse-client --query "ALTER TABLE tracium.spans DELETE WHERE <predicate>"

# 2. Inspect what the rebuild would do — changes nothing.
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint ./repair-rollup api \
  --from 2026-07-14 --to 2026-07-16 --dry-run

# 3. Rebuild those days.
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint ./repair-rollup api \
  --from 2026-07-14 --to 2026-07-16 --yes
```

Step 1 must complete before step 2. The rebuild reads whatever is in
`tracium.spans` at the time it runs, so a span still present is faithfully
re-aggregated back into the rollup.

Flags: `--from`/`--to` (inclusive day range), `--dry-run`, `--allow-empty`,
`--force` (skip the quiescence guard; only with ingestion stopped), `--yes`
(no confirmation prompt), `--quiesce-seconds` (default 300). Run with `-h` for
the full list.

## What the command protects you from

It refuses to run rather than write aggregates it cannot vouch for:

- **Schema drift.** Migrations use `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`, so a long-lived
  deployment's objects can differ from the schema files. On every run the command
  normalises each rollup's materialized-view SELECT (via `EXPLAIN SYNTAX`) and
  compares it against the aggregation it mirrors internally, for **both**
  `metrics_daily` and `metrics_daily_cost`, and aborts on any mismatch — so it
  never writes aggregates the live trigger would not have produced. (This guard,
  and the tool itself, are unit-tested in `api/internal/rolluprepair`.)
- **Still-open days.** Rebuilding a day that is still receiving spans
  double-counts them — the view inserts a partial for each new span and the
  rebuild reads it too. Days with recent arrivals are refused unless you stop
  ingestion and pass `--force`. Late spans arriving *after* a rebuild are fine:
  the view adds them on top, exactly as it would have.
- **Aged-out days.** If a day's raw spans have already expired under the spans
  TTL, rebuilding would replace real history with an empty day — the rollups
  deliberately outlive raw spans. Such days are skipped unless you pass
  `--allow-empty`.

## Cost

Bounded by the days you request, never by the table size — the span read is a
half-open `start_time_ms` range that prunes on the sort key. There is no
"rebuild everything" mode; at Tracium's scale bar that would be unrunnable.

## Prevention

Ingest-side bounds (token ceilings, and ignoring client-reported cost unless
explicitly trusted) stop this class of poison from being priced and stored in
the first place. This command is for cleaning up damage already done.
