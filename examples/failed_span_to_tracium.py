"""
Emit a trace containing a **failed** LLM span and ship it to the locally-hosted
Tracium stack — so you can see how the collector and UI handle errors, not just
the happy path.

The scenario is a realistic production incident. A nightly **invoice-extraction
job** reads scanned invoices and asks an LLM to pull out structured fields. Two
documents come through fine, but the third trips a failure that actually happens
in the wild: an operator pinned the model name from a config file, and that
value has a typo (``gpt-4o-miini``). OpenAI rejects the request with a 404
``model_not_found`` error, the OpenLLMetry instrumentation records the exception
on the gen_ai span and sets its status to ERROR, and the surrounding task/
workflow spans fail with it.

    invoice-extraction-batch          (workflow)  → ends ERROR
    ├─ extract-invoice  (INV-9001)    (task)      → ok
    ├─ extract-invoice  (INV-9002)    (task)      → ok
    └─ extract-invoice  (INV-9003)    (task)      → ERROR  ← the failed span
        └─ openai.chat                (LLM)       → ERROR  (404 model_not_found)

So a single run produces a trace where a real gen_ai.* span carries
exception.type / exception.message events and status_code=ERROR, exactly the
shape the enrichment pipeline and the UI's error views need to be exercised
against. The failing call never reaches token billing (OpenAI rejects it before
inference), so this also checks that a priced-zero, errored span is handled
gracefully.

The failure is genuine — we send a malformed request to the real API rather
than faking a status — because the whole point is to verify end-to-end error
propagation through the collector. The first two calls are real, cheap
gpt-4o-mini requests; only the third is intentionally broken.

Run the stack first:   docker compose up -d collector clickhouse postgres
Then:                  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
