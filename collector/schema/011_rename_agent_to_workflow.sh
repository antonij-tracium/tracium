# Sourced by run-migrations.sh. Renames the collector-derived owning-identity
# column agent_name → workflow_name across the span store and the daily rollup.
#
# The dimension was mislabelled "agent": it is the workflow a trace is grouped
# under (derived from service.name / traceloop.workflow.name / gen_ai.agent.name /
# the span name), not an agent in the gen_ai sense. The span `kind` value "agent"
# and the source attribute gen_ai.agent.name are genuine agent concepts and are
# left untouched.
#
# Fresh databases already have workflow_name (migrations 001–003 create it), so
# this is a no-op there. On an existing install the rename is applied in place.
# Ingestion SHOULD be stopped for the rebuild: while the rollup MV is dropped and
# recreated, spans inserted in the gap are not folded into metrics_daily.
#
# tracium.spans.workflow_name is a plain column → ALTER RENAME COLUMN.
# tracium.metrics_daily.workflow_name is part of the sorting key → it cannot be
# renamed in place, so the table is swapped and its aggregate states copied
# positionally into the new layout (same technique as migration 004).
