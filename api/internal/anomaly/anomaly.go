// Package anomaly is the statistical core of Tracium's anomaly detection. It is
// deliberately free of any database or HTTP dependency: it scores an
// evenly-bucketed numeric series against its own recent history and returns the
// buckets that deviate significantly. The query layer feeds it series pulled
// from the daily rollup; a future background/alerting job can reuse the exact
// same scoring without change.
//
// Method — robust z-score over a trailing baseline:
//
//	z = (observed − median) / (1.4826 × MAD)
//
// Median and MAD (median absolute deviation) are used instead of mean and
// standard deviation because LLM cost/latency/volume series are heavy-tailed:
// the very spikes we hunt would poison a mean-based baseline, masking themselves
// and the next few points. Robust statistics ignore a handful of outliers in the
// baseline, so a spike does not hide the spike after it. 1.4826 rescales MAD to
// be a consistent estimator of the standard deviation for normal data, so the
// familiar z thresholds (≈3σ) keep their usual meaning.
//
// Two floors keep the score from firing on noise, and both must be cleared in
// addition to the z threshold:
//
//   - AbsFloor: the absolute deviation |observed − expected| must exceed a
//     metric-specific minimum. This kills the "$0.01 → $0.05 is 5×!" problem and
//     is also what makes a flat (MAD=0) baseline safe to score.
//   - VolumeFloor: the series must carry enough activity (Support) to be worth
//     scoring at all, so a barely-used workflow with two runs a week does not
//     generate a stream of alerts.
