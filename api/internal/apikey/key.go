// Package apikey issues and verifies per-workspace ingestion credentials.

// A key is a single opaque token of the form:
//
//	trc_<hex-encoded random bytes>
//
// Only the token's SHA-256 hash is persisted; the plaintext is returned to the
// caller once at creation and cannot be recovered afterwards. Verification
// hashes the presented token and looks the row up by hash, so the lookup is
// exact and constant work regardless of how many keys exist — there is no
// per-candidate secret comparison to time-attack.
